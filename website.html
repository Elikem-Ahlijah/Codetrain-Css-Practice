                    I love to do. I love music, reading books and coding.

            <div id="row-2">
                <h1>Basketball</h1>
                <p>This is one on my favourite activities. 
                    When I not codingyou may find me on a basketball court near you,
                    shooting some hoops. This is a wonderful form of exercise,
                    this sport worksout every inch of yourbody. When I am playing this game
                    I forget about all the stress of every day life.<br><br> Basketball is a team sport
                    usually played between two teams of five. You could also play three a side.
                    It is very important one plays a team game in oorder to be able to participate in 
                    teams like when coding a project.

                <p></p>
                <h1>Travel, Adventure, Love And Nature</h1>
                <p>Another activity apart from basketball, that I love to endulge is to Travel
                    to beautiful places of nature. I love the serene freshness one experiences in 
                    such locations. After spending so much time in the busy, polluted city
                    it pays to take a break and chill. <br><br>
                    
                    We all need to travel to a serene place of nature every once i a while. It helps
                    with the stress of urban life. Out there one can reflect and meditate.</p>
